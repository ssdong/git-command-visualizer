      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1>Git commands visualizer (Scala-powered)</h1>
    <p class="project-description">
      Git commands visualizer is a 100% Scala-based project that aims to help understand and clarify various git concepts through visualization.
      This is my first attempt to write a complete ScalaJS(with Slinky) project and the outcome is more than satisfying.
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">Git commands prove to be not so trivial to grasp a full and through understanding against it.
      It has a high entry barrier for beginners and sometimes even for veterans, for instance <span class="command">git cherry-pick</span>.
      Scala has proved itself to be a beautify and powerful language throughout the implementation that it handles everything from parsing
      user inputs to rendering on the screen smoothly. Feedbacks are welcome. :)
